**Revolution Emulator**

Revolution Emulator (RevEmu, revemu, Rev) is a new Habbo Hotel emulation
environment, designed to work with Habbo’s flash protocol. 

Built around speed & stability, Rev offers a brand new & open source
alternative to popular environments such as Butterfly & Phoenix, both of
which are proprietary and out of date. It is a modularised server,
allowing you to add components and remove components. Revolution is a
product of hard work and sustained development over a period of 10
months.

**Information**

Rev’s current developers (as of time of writing) are:

-   Zak
-   Adil
